              The aviation industry often presents a paradox: demand for experience without clear pathways to obtain it, especially for newly commercial or recently graduated pilots. Many low-timer pilots struggle to find direction, facing challenges due to the scarcity of pilot-oriented internship programs. The Wing Mentorship Program is designed to directly address this critical gap, providing a structured environment for you to gain invaluable, hands-on experience and guidance.
